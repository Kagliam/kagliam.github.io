 <h1 style="font-size:75px;">WHY I CHOSE AP COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>
  
 <H1>The reason I decided to take ap computer science was because im in avid and one of our requirements for graduation is to get an
   ap class credit. Also one of my former english teacher Myers suggested that I should take it. Also I was intrested in the games 
   that they showed me they made in class.</H1>


<h1 style="font-size:75px;">WHAT I HOPE TO BENIFIT FROM THIS CLASS</h1>
  
<H1>What I hope to benefit from taking ap computer science is to learn how to code websites and games. And maybe help me with other 
  things like time-management, organization, and productivity</H1>
