 <h1 style="font-size:75px;">KRISTOPHER AGLIAM</h1>

  <h1 style="font-size:50px;"WHO AM I</h1>
  
  <p>My name is Kristopher but you can call me Kris for short. I am sixteen years old. I am filipino and I was born and raised
    in ewa but my parents are from the philipines. I went to holomua elementart and ilima intermediate My favorite food is 
    adobo chicken. My favorite ice cream would have to be chocolate chip mint. My dream career is a general contractor and im 
    almost there. When I grow up I want to build a nice house in Ewa Beach are to be near to those who helped me. My dream car 
    is a corvette and my dream truck is a silverado.
     
  <h1 style="font-size:50px;"HOBBIES</h1>
    
  <p> I have two hobbies which is remote control cars and wood working. I got into remote controls when I was in 7th grade 
    because I seen the gas one my brother-in-law had so it made me want to get one and so I did. So now I have a off roading rc,
    street rc, and a drifter. Like all hobbies its expensive so I hardly do it as much as I used to. Then I started woodworking 
    because I got bored and would have nothing to do so I just found what ever was around my house and started to make any
    project.</p>
  
    <h1 style="font-size:50px;"WHAT I DO AS A JOB</h1>
  
  <p> As a job I do plumbing, electrical, and carpenter. I started getting into my first trade which was electrical when
    I was in seventh grade. Before that I would just past tools than finally my dad let me give it a try and it went from there.
    Then in eighth grade my uncle started taking me to teach me how to do plumbing and carpentry which kinda the same as doing 
    electrical but in a different catagory. One day I hope to be running a world wide construction company.
